The prototype of the game for Ludum Dare Game Jam. Surviving on a desert planet, finding parts in piles of rubbish, building a rocket and traveling in time - all of this could be in our game if we completed it.

## What's ready:
* Random generator of objects on the map and their inventories.
* Rocket assembly.
* Prototype of random event.
* Rocket launch.
* Death.

## Play now!
